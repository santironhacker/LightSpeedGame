        <p class="center">EPISODE IV<br />A NEW HOPE FOR CSS3</p>

        <p>It is a period of vendor war.</p>
        
        <p>This is a demonstration of Star Wars-style scrolling 3D titles in CSS3. It possibly has no practical purpose whatsoever but it looks great and you can impress your friends.</p>
        
        <p>Before movie-buffs start ranting, I realize Star Wars wasn't the first to use crawling 3D titles, but few of you will remember the Flash Gordon series or the 1936 adaption of HG Wells' "Things to Come".</p>
        
        <p>Also, by mentioning "Star Wars", everyone will understand what I mean. And I'll receive several thousand more visits.</p>
        
        <p>The scrolling titles work well in Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Opera doesn't implement 3D transforms yet, but the text will scroll. IE users receive a blank page. A shame, but IE10 should support it.</p>
